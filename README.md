# Lutra – Reasonable Ontology Template (OTTR) reference implementation

Detailed documentation on the OTTR framework can be found on our web site: https://ottr.xyz/.

Lutra is our open source reference implementation of the OTTR language available under an LGPL licence. Lutra can read and write OTTR templates and instances on different serialisation formats, and expand instances into regular RDF graphs or RDF/OWL ontologies. Lutra is written in Java 11 and is currently available for use as a command line interface.


## Running and installation

### Prerequisites

To run Lutra you will need to install Java, for instance [OpenJDK][1].

### Downloads

* Releases: [for download at ottr.xyz][11] and [the list of all releases on GitLab][2]
* [Latest master snapshot][3]: usually the latest release
* [Latest develop snapshot][4]: usually the latest development version
* [Maven artefacts](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:xyz.ottr.lutra): The entry point module to use Lutra as an Java API is `lutra-api`. 
* [Javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/xyz.ottr.lutra)

### Installing

Simply download the executable jar file. No installation required.

Run the jar file with for example: `java -jar lutra.jar --help`.

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning][8].

See the [tags on this repository][6] for release versions and other important milestones. 

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for a description of the major changes between versions. 

## Building

To build, clone the project and use Maven: `mvn package`. This will produce the executable jar at `lutra-cli/target/lutra.jar`.

Note that the default branch of the project is the `develop` branch.

Requirements:

* Java 17, for instance [OpenJDK][1]
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Java build and IDE plug-in.
Free plug-ins are available for most IDEs. For guides on how to install, please check the _Install_-section on the Lombok website.
_Note: The Maven build will work without the plug-in, but despite this the IDE will show errors because it cannot resolve methods that are generated by the plug-in._

The project depends on external libraries, for details see [pom.xml](pom.xml).

### Building on Windows

If you are building on Windows and get the following exception during build:
```
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```
then see [this](https://gitlab.com/ottr/lutra/lutra/issues/94#note_153568457) comment on [Issue 94](https://gitlab.com/ottr/lutra/lutra/issues/94) for possible work-arounds.
